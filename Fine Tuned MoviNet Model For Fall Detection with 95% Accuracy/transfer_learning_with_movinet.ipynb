        "\n",
        "MoViNets (Mobile Video Networks) provide a family of efficient video classification models, supporting inference on streaming video. In this tutorial, you will use a pre-trained MoViNet model to classify videos, specifically for an action recognition task, from the [UCF101 dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php). A pre-trained model is a saved network that was previously trained on a larger dataset. You can find more details about MoViNets in the [MoViNets: Mobile Video Networks for Efficient Video Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11511) paper by Kondratyuk, D. et al. (2021). In this tutorial, you will:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Learn how to download a pre-trained MoViNet model\n",
        "* Create a new model using a pre-trained model with a new classifier by freezing the convolutional base of the MoViNet model\n",
        "* Replace the classifier head with the number of labels of a new dataset\n",
        "* Perform transfer learning on the [UCF101 dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php)\n",
        "\n",
        "The model downloaded in this tutorial is from [official/projects/movinet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/movinet). This repository contains a collection of MoViNet models that TF Hub uses in the TensorFlow 2 SavedModel format.\n",
        "\n",
        "This transfer learning tutorial is the third part in a series of TensorFlow video tutorials. Here are the other three tutorials:\n",
        "\n",
        "- [Load video data](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/video): This tutorial explains much of the code used in this document; in particular, how to preprocess and load data through the `FrameGenerator` class is explained in more detail.\n",
        "- [Build a 3D CNN model for video classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/video/video_classification). Note that this tutorial uses a (2+1)D CNN that decomposes the spatial and temporal aspects of 3D data; if you are using volumetric data such as an MRI scan, consider using a 3D CNN instead of a (2+1)D CNN.\n",

The data does not have to be limited to video data. Volumetric data, such as MRI scans, can also be used with 3D CNNs. The NUSDAT and IMH datasets mentioned in [Brain MRI-based 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Schizophrenia and Controls](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08818.pdf) could be two such sources for MRI data.\n",
